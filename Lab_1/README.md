# Lab 1 - CSE 3200

My apologies for pushing this up late. I was not able to get Android Studio to work until Spring Break. I used that time to work on the Midterm and now I can turn in the previous work. I've also had issues with Github, but, as you can see, that's also been fixed!

I've updated pieces of the code so that the app can work as intended.

In order to run the app:
* Clone the repo at https://github.com/sergio-montufar-uconn/cse3200/new/main/Lab_1.git
* Download the app onto your local machine.
* Open the app on Android Studio, run it, and see it unfold.
